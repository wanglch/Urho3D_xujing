Documentation
-------------

Urho3D classes have been sparsely documented using Doxygen notation. To
generate documentation into the "Docs" subdirectory, open the Doxyfile in the
"Docs" subdirectory with doxywizard and click "Run doxygen" from the "Run" tab.
Get Doxygen from http://www.doxygen.org & Graphviz from http://www.graphviz.org.
See section "Documentation build" below on how to automate documentation
generation as part of the build process.

The documentation is also available online at http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/


Building prerequisites
----------------------

Although all required third-party libraries are included as source code, there
are system-level dependencies that must be satisfied before Urho3D can be built
successfully:

- For Windows, the June 2010 DirectX SDK needs to be installed.

- For Linux, the following development packages need to be installed:
  libx11-dev, libxrandr-dev, libasound2-dev on Debian-based distros;
  libX11-devel, libXrandr-devel, alsa-lib-devel on RedHat-based distros.
  Also install the package libgl1-mesa-dev (Debian) or mesa-libGL-devel (RH)
  if your GPU driver does not include OpenGL headers & libs. Building as 32-bit 
  on a 64-bit system requires installing also the 32-bit versions of the 
  development libraries.

- For Raspberry Pi, the following development packages need to be installed:
  libraspberrypi0, libraspberrypi-dev, libasound2-dev, libudev-dev on Raspbian;
  raspberrypi-vc-libs, raspberrypi-vc-libs-devel, alsa-lib-devel, systemd-devel
  on Pidora. The first two packages which contain the Broadcom VideoCore IV
  libraries and development headers should normally come preinstalled.

- For Mac OS X, the Xcode developer tools package should include everything
  necessary.

- For Android, the Android SDK and Android NDK (minimum API level 12) need to be
  installed. Optionally, also install Eclipse ADT plugin for building and 
  deployment via Eclipse.

To run Urho3D, the minimum system requirements are:

- Windows: CPU with SSE instructions support, Windows XP or newer, DirectX 9.0c,
  GPU with Shader Model 2 support (Shader Model 3 recommended.)

- Linux & Mac OS X: CPU with SSE instructions support, GPU with OpenGL 2.0
  support, EXT_framebuffer_object and EXT_packed_depth_stencil extensions.

- Raspberry Pi: Model B revision 2.0 with at least 128 MB of 512 MB SDRAM
  allocated for GPU. OpenGL ES 2.0 capable GPU.

- Android: OS version 2.3 or newer, OpenGL ES 2.0 capable GPU.

- iOS: OpenGL ES 2.0 capable GPU.

SSE requirement can be eliminated by disabling the use of SSE instruction set,
see "Build options" below.


Desktop build process
---------------------

On desktop systems Urho3D uses CMake (http://www.cmake.org) to build. The
process has two steps:

1) Run CMake in the root directory with your preferred toolchain specified to
   generate the build files. You can use the provided batch files or shell
   scripts on the respective platform.
   
    Windows: cmake_vs2008.bat, cmake_vs2010.bat, cmake_vs2012.bat, or
             cmake_mingw.bat,
    Linux: cmake_gcc.sh, cmake_eclipse.sh, or cmake_codeblocks.sh,
    Mac OS X: cmake_gcc.sh or cmake_macosx.sh.

2) Open the CMake's generated project file in the IDE of your choice. Change the
   build configuration (Debug/Release) and then build all the targets.

   Visual Studio: open Urho3D.sln from the Build directory.
   Xcode: open Urho3D.xcodeproj.
   CodeBlocks: open Urho3D.cbp.
   Eclipse: import project using File|Import "Existing Projects into Workspace".
   GCC: execute make from the Build directory in a terminal/console.

Note that Eclipse requires CDT plugin to build C/C++ project.

If using MinGW to compile, DirectX headers may need to be acquired separately.
They can be copied to the MinGW installation eg. from the following package:
http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/common/directx-devel.tar.gz. These will
be missing some of the headers related to shader compilation, so a MinGW build 
will use OpenGL by default. To build in Direct3D9 mode, the MinGW-w64 port is 
necessary: http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/. Using it, Direct3D9 can be 
enabled with the CMake option -DURHO3D_OPENGL=0.

After the build is complete, the programs can be run from the Bin directory.
These include the Urho3D player application, which can run application scripts,
the tools, and C++ sample applications if they have been enabled.

To run the Urho3D player application from the Visual Studio debugger, set the 
Urho3DPlayer project as the startup project and enter its relative path and 
filename into Properties -> Debugging -> Command: ..\..\..\Bin\Urho3DPlayer.exe.
Additionally, entering -w into Debugging -> Command Arguments is highly
recommended. This enables startup in windowed mode: without it running into an
exception or breakpoint will be obnoxious as the mouse cursor will likely be
hidden. To actually make the Urho3DPlayer application do something useful, it
must be supplied with the name of the script file it should load and run. You
can try for example the following arguments: Scripts/NinjaSnowWar.as -w

To run from Eclipse on Linux, locate and select the Urho3DPlayer executable in
the Project Explorer. From the menu, choose "Run Configurations" to create a new
launch configuration for "C/C++ Application". Switch to "Arguments" tab, specify
the argument required by Urho3DPlayer executable.

To run from Xcode on Mac OS X, edit the Product Scheme to set "Run" setting
to execute "Urho3DPlayer" in the "Info" tab. In the "Arguments" tab, specify the
arguments required by Urho3DPlayer executable. Ensure the check boxes are ticked
on the argument entries that you want to be active.

CMake caches some internal variables to speed up the subsequent invocation of
the CMake build script. This is normally a good thing. However, there are cases
when this is not desirable, for instance when switching CMake generators or
after upgrading development software components. In such cases, it is recomended
to first clean the CMake cache by invoking cmake_clean.bat or cmake_clean.sh.


Android build process
---------------------

First, if you are building under Windows platform without MKLINK support then
copy Bin/Data and Bin/CoreData directories to the Source/Android/assets
directory (you can use the provided batch file CopyData.bat). This step is not
necessary for Windows with MKLINK support and non-Windows platforms because the
build script uses symbolic links for platforms that support it.

Set the ANDROID_NDK environment variable to point to your Android NDK. On 
Windows, ensure that make.exe from the Android NDK is included in the path and
is executable from the command line.

On Windows, execute cmake_android.bat. If MKLINK support is available, provide
build option "-DURHO3D_MKLINK=1" to generate out-of-source build. Then go to the
build directory Source/Android (or android-Build if out-of-source build) and
execute the following commands. On OS X or Linux, execute cmake_gcc.sh (the
ANDROID_NDK environment variable distinguishes from a normal desktop build) then
go to the android-Build directory (always an out-of-source build) and execute
the following commands.

- android update project -p . -t 1 (only needed on the first time,
                                    replace '-t 1' with desired target-id)
- make -j8 (replace '-j8' with the number of logical CPU cores of the 
            host/build system)
- ant debug

After the commands finish successfully, the APK should have been generated to
the build's "bin" subdirectory, from where it can be installed on a device or an
emulator. The command "ant installd" can be used for this.

For a release build, use the "ant release" command instead of "ant debug" and
follow the Android SDK instructions on how to sign your APK properly.

By default the Android package for Urho3D is com.googlecode.urho3d. For a real
application you must replace this with your own package name. The Urho3D
activity subclasses the SDLActivity from org.libsdl.app package, whose name
(or the JNI code from SDL library) does not have to be changed.

Note that the native code is built by default for armeabi-v7a ABI. To make your
program compatible also with old Android devices, build also an armeabi version
by executing the CMake batch file again with the parameter -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi
added, then execute make again in the build directory.

You can also build and deploy using Eclipse IDE with ADT plugin. To do that,
after setting the ANDROID_NDK environment variable then run cmake_eclipse.sh.
Import "Existing Android Code into Workspace" from the CMake generated Eclipse's
project found in the android-Build directory. Switch Eclipse IDE to use Java
Perspective. Update project properties to choose the desired Android API target
and that's it. Just choose "Run" to let ADT automatically build and deploy the
application to Android (virtual) device.


iOS build process
-----------------

Run cmake_ios.sh. This generates an Xcode project named Urho3D.xcodeproj.

Open the Xcode project and check the properties for the Urho3D project (topmost
in the Project Navigator.) In Architectures -> Base SDK, choose your iOS SDK
(CMake would automatically select latest iOS when generating the Xcode project).
In Code Signing, enter your developer identity as necessary.

The Urho3DPlayer target will actually build the application bundle and copy
resources from Bin/Data and Bin/CoreData directories. Edit its build scheme to
choose debug or release mode.

To run from Xcode on iPhone/iPad Simulator, edit the Product Scheme to set "Run"
destination setting to "iPhone Simulator" or "iPad Simulator", and executable
to "Urho3DPlayer.app".


Raspberry Pi build process
--------------------------

For native build on Raspberry Pi itself, use the similar process for Linux
Desktop build described above.

For cross-compiling build on another build/host machine, firstly set the
RASPI_TOOL environment variable to point to your Raspberry Pi Cross-Compiling
tool where all the arm-linux-gnueabihf-* executables are located. You can setup
the tool using crosstool-NG (http://crosstool-ng.org/) or just download one
from https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools. Secondly, set the RASPI_ROOT
environment variable to point to your Raspbian or Pidora system root. You must
install the Urho3D prerequisites software development packages for Raspberry Pi
(see "Building_Prerequisites") in the system root before attempting to do the
Urho3D cross-compiling build. You can download a Raspbian system root from
https://github.com/urho3d/rpi-sysroot.

When running cmake_gcc.sh with RASPI_TOOL environment variable set, it tells
build script to generate additional raspi-Build directory for cross-compiling.
Go to this raspi-Build directory and proceed to execute make. After the build
is complete, the ARM executables can be found in Bin-CC output directory.

You can also build, deploy, run/debug (as C/C++ Remote Application) using
Eclipse IDE, if you run cmake_eclipse.sh to generate the project file. Import
the CMake generated Eclipse project in the raspi-Build directory into Eclipse's
workspace. Build the project as usual. Use the URHO3D_SCP_TO_TARGET build option
to automatically deploy the ARM executables to target Raspberry Pi as part of
every project build or configure Eclipse to perform a "download to target path"
in the Run/Debug configuration for C/C++ Remote Application. Either way, you
have to configure the Run/Debug configuration how to reach your target Raspberry
Pi.


MinGW cross-compile build process
---------------------------------

It is possible to cross-compile Urho3D for Windows using a Linux system. The
process is largely the same as for the Linux Desktop build process described
above.

To cross-compile, the MinGW tool-chain (compiler, linker and w32api) needs to be
installed on the system. You will also need the DirectX header files, those can
be downloaded and installed from the following packet:
http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/common/directx-devel.tar.gz.

For activating the MinGW tool-chain, and to allow it to find the correct
compiler, the MINGW_PREFIX environment variable needs to be set when running
cmake_gcc.sh. This variable should be set to the prefix of the compiler name.
So, if for example your MinGW compiler is named i686-pc-mingw32-gcc, the
MINGW_PREFIX should read i686-pc. Most likely you also need to set MINGW_ROOT
environment variable to point to your mingw32 system root.

Running cmake_gcc.sh with the MINGW_PREFIX environment variable set, produces
an additional mingw-Build directory. Go to this directory and execute make to
start the build process. When the build is complete, the Windows executables can
be found in the mingw-Bin output directory.


Desktop 64bit build
-------------------

Currently CMake build configuration has been set to compile Urho3D as 32bit by
default. To enable 64bit build, run the provided cmake_xxxx.bat or cmake_xxxx.sh
by passing the option "-DURHO3D_64BIT=1" explicitly. For Visual Studio on
Windows platform, this option also overrides CMake to use a 64bit solution
generator.


Library build
-------------

As of v1.31, the build process first builds the Urho3D library target (either
static or shared). The library is then linked against by other targets like
tools and samples that reference Urho3D as one of the external libraries. The
Urho3D library type is defaulted to static, so the build process would generate
standalone executables as previous releases. The Urho3D library type can be
changed using "URHO3D_LIB_TYPE" build option.

To install the Urho3D library (or should we call it SDK), use the usual
'make install' command when using Makefile. There is an equivalent command in
Visual Studio and Xcode IDE to build 'install' target instead of the default
'all' target. This could be useful when you want your application to always link
against a 'stable' installed version of the Urho3D library, while keeping your
Urho3D project root tree in sync with origin/master. That is, install the newly
built library after you have tested the changes do not break your application
during development.

Refer to "Using Urho3D as external library" on how to setup your own project to
use Urho3D as external library.


Documentation build
-------------------

If URHO3D_DOCS build option is set then a normal (ALL) build would not only
build Urho3D software but also Urho3D documentation automatically. If it is not
then the documentation can be generated by manually invoking 'make doc' command
or its equivalent command in IDE.

The prerequisites are Doxygen and Graphviz. Tools to dump the AngelScript API
for the default scripting subsystem and the LuaScript API (when the LuaScript
subsystem is also enabled) will be built internally when all the tools are being
built.


Compiling Direct3D shaders
--------------------------

When building with the Windows 8 SDK, copy d3dcompiler_46.dll from
C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/8.0/bin/x86 to Urho3D Bin directory so that
Urho3D executables will run correctly.

Note that you can also force an OpenGL mode build on Windows by using the CMake
option in the table below; OpenGL does not depend on a separate shader compiler
DLL.


Build options
-------------

A number of build options can be defined explicitly when invoking the above
cmake_xxxx batch files or shell scripts.

|---------------------|-|------------------------------------------------------|

|                     | | has a pattern of usr@tgt:remote-loc                  |
|CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     |*|Specify CMake build configuration to be generated     |

|                     | | values are armeabi-v7a (*default) and armeabi        |
|---------------------|-|------------------------------------------------------|

Note that build option values specified via command line are cached by CMake.
The cached values will be used by CMake in the subsequent invocation. That is,
the same build options are not required to be specified again and again. Once a
non-default build option value is being cached, it can only be reverted back to
its default value by explicitly setting it via command line. That is, simply by
NOT passing the corresponding build option would not work. One way to revert all
the build options to their default values is by clearing the CMake cache by
calling cmake_clean.bat or cmake_clean.sh.


Using cmake-gui to configure and generate Urho3D project file
-------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of using one of the provided batch files or shell scripts, you can use
cmake-gui to configure and generate Urho3D project file. However, you have to
adhere to the current limitations:

- The build directory must be located inside the Urho3D project root directory
  and sibling of the "Source" directory.
- The build directory must be named accordingly based on the target platform.
    - On desktop/native platform: Build
    - On Windows platform using MinGW: mingw-Build
    - On iOS platform: ios-Build
    - On Android platform: android-Build
    - On Raspberry Pi platform: raspi-Build
- The runtime and archive output directories are automatically set based on the
  target platform regardless of the build directory name (should you choose not
  to adhere with the above). For example on Android platform, they will be
  android-Bin and android-Lib, respectively.
  If you choose not to adhere with this build directory naming convention then
  you will have to install the Urho3D library into your local filesystem in
  order to use the Urho3D library in your external project
  (See http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/a00001.html#Building_Library and
  http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/a00004.html#UsingLibraryFromSDK).
- All the post-CMake workaround and/or bug fixes that are scripted in the batch
  files or shell scripts are not applied to the generated project file.

Steps to configure:

1. In the Urho3D project root directory, invoke "cmake-gui Source".
2. Set the build directory name.
3. Configure and update the build options as many times as necessary until there
   are no more new options in red. For the first configuration, choose the
   generator you like to use. Click the Group check box to group the build
   options.
    - In the Ungrouped Entries: only check one of these options (ANDROID, IOS,
      RASPI) when you target the platform, leave them unchecked for
      dekstop/native build.
    - In the URHO3D group: check any of the options you desire. Some of the
      options when checked may cause new options to be made available in the
      subsequent configuration loop.
4. Generate when all the configurations are done.


History
